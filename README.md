<h1>Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Inspecting Traffic Between Azure Virtual Machines</h1>
In this project I built up my practical knowledge of networking using azure virtual machines, wireshark, and network security groups. <br />


<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Various Command-Line Tools
- Various Network Protocols (SSH, RDH, DNS, HTTP/S, ICMP)
- Wireshark (Protocol Analyzer)

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10 (21H2)
- Ubuntu Server 20.04

<h2>High-Level Steps</h2>

1. Set up Windows and Linux Virtual Machines in Azure
2. Use Remote Desktop to connect to Windows VM
3. Install Wireshark and observe network protocols
4. Analyze data packets in Wireshark while running various protocols
5. Disconnect and Delete Resources on Azure (very important!)

<h2>What I Learned</h2>


<h2>My Approach to Learning</h2>

<p>After completing this lab and tinkering with wireshark and virtual machines. I decided to explore further and use chatGPT to expand my knowledge. In this video I explain my exact process and how anyone can use this process to learn networking.</p>
